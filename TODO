o Fixes
    - read .papageorge.conf in site- if not found in ~/
    - board replace for following highest rated games
        -> add tick to popover: Observe all games in this board
        it could be checked automatically for the next board
        when follow is issued
        new observed games would be assigned to that board unless
        an observe command was issued for that game particularly?
    - calculate initial window size for a fixed width and turn boxes above and below
